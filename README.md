# Project Brief
**Client name:** Social Buzz

**Client industry:** Social media & content creation

## Client Background: 
Social Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, 
only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can 
react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments. 
This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user 
feeds.

Over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. 
They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee 
their scaling process effectively. 

Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they 
create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging 
from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and 
requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain.

## Client Request:
To start our engagement with Social Buzz, we are running a 3 month initial project in order 
to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following: 
- An audit of their big data practice 
- Recommendations for a successful IPO 
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the 
largest aggregate popularity

## Insights and Recommendations:
